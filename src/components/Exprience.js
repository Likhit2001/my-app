              Developed an automated the video capturing process for an in-house
              developed imaging device used for specimen analysis.
              <br />
              Integrated hardware and software by establishing serial
              connectivity with an Arduino board, utilizing Python libraries
              such as PyFirmata and OpenCV for efficient control and data
              processing.
              <br />
              Effectively automated the video capture procedure, allowing
              researchers to carry out scans, keep data consistent, and
              eventually improve the quality of their analysis
