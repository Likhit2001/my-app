        <h2>About</h2>
        
        I am a Fall24 Masters student at University of Colorado, Boulder, in the computer science department.
        <br/>
       
        My experience includes two research internships at INMAS, Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), where I worked on automation, image processing, and artificial intelligence projects. These opportunities allowed me to apply classroom theories to practical scenarios, enhancing my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities.

        In addition, I lead the web team at Zero1Coded, a student club focused on coding and web development. This role has provided me with valuable experience in collaboration, project management, and innovation.

        I am motivated by the chance to use my skills and creativity to make a positive impact on society and the environment. I value diversity, innovation, and teamwork, and I am eager to bring my unique perspective to new challenges and opportunities.
